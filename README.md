# PatagoniaMet: A multi-source hydrometeorological dataset for Western Patagonia  

Western Patagonia (40-56ºS), one of the largest and best-preserved freshwater ecosystems in the world, is a clear example of how the systematic lack of data (or publicly accessible), and poor-quality control protocols, have hindered further hydrometeorological studies. To address these limitations, we present PatagoniaMet (PMET), a compilation of ground-based hydrometeorological data (PMET-obs; 1950-2020), and a daily gridded product of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature (PMET-sim; 0.05º, 1980-2020). The complete dataset of PatagoniaMet can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/7992761 

## About this repository

This repository contains all the code used to process the raw data and generate the figures in the corresponding manuscript. This repository also acts as a website to publicly discuss changes and add new data to this region. 


## How to contribute

PatagoniaMet is a collaborative and open dataset that is designed to continuously evolve by incorporating new records, meteorological variables, institutions, and time-steps as they become accessible. This dynamic dataset serves as a fundamental resource for future hydrometeorological research in Western Patagonia, available to and reviewable by the entire community. A guide to sharing new data is currently being developed.
